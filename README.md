# AutomationPractice
Welcome to my test repo! It was created for some practice and to show my skills. For testing purposes I choose http://www.automationpractice.pl/index.php site because it's far from perfect and have bad HTML, so it's more challenging to work with it and it requires some tricky solutions for some simple actions. 

# Getting started
1. Clone repo
2. Install extension "Specflow for Visual Studio 2022"
3. Build project
4. Run tests from "Test explorer"
